Push_swap - Sorting Algorithm Implementation for Stack Manipulation

Welcome to Push_swap, a project focused on efficiently sorting stacks using a minimal set of operations. This implementation employs radix sorting algorithms to organize data in a stack, providing an optimized solution for ordering a set of integers.

** Project Overview **

- What does Push_swap do?
      - Push_swap aims to efficiently sort a stack of integers using two stacks, A and B, and a limited set of operations. The project explores different sorting algorithms, seeking the most optimal combination of operations to minimize the number of moves required. It is designed to handle both small and large datasets with speed and efficiency.

- Key Features
    - Sorting Algorithms: Push_swap employs radix sort algorithms, optimizing the order of elements within the stack.
    - Stack Manipulation: The project utilizes stack manipulation operations to reorder elements, exploring the most efficient combinations to achieve sorting.

** How to Compile Push_swap **

To compile the Push_swap program, follow these straightforward steps:

  - Clone the Repository:
    - git clone git@github.com:Bgarnn/C-PushSwap.git
    - cd C-PushSwap
  - Compile the Program:
    - make: This will generate the push_swap executable.
  - Clean the Build:
    - make clean: This removes the object files, leaving only the compiled program.

** Now you can use Push_swap to efficiently sort your stacks!


** Usage Example

./push_swap 3 1 4 2

(This will output a list of operations to sort the stack.)
